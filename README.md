SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.


## Problem Statement 

How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?


## Approach 
The overall methodology includes:

### Data collection, wrangling, and formatting, using:
  - SpaceX API
  - Web scraping
### Exploratory data analysis (EDA), using:
  - Pandas and NumPy
  - SQL
  - Data visualization, using:
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn
    - Folium
    - Dash
### Machine learning prediction, using
  - Logistic regression
  - Support vector machine (SVM)
  - Decision tree
  - K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
